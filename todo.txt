Features:
Change the play button on play, make better stop button

Big Features:
When looping is disabled, hitting play again will play *that same pattern* again. It currently advances it.
Make a thing that lets you see the letters of each note played?




bugs:
First pattern sometimes plays strangely
Unchecking loop patterns causes abrupt stop that cuts off final note
